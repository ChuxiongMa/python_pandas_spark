1. Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density? Briefly explain why or why not.

I don't think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density. Based on the output, with the growth of temperatures,
the population density doesn't increase too much, it still distribute evenly. Temperature doesn't have a strong correlation with population density.

2. The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed throughout the analysis. Constantly decompressing the data seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with the uncompressed .json data?

Uncompressed .json data is larger than compressed, so reading uncompressed file takes more time especially when data file is very large.
Small compressed file spend less time to load.
