1. In the hint above, describe the values that are the result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? How is this calculated?

The points on both sides of the best-fit line have the same intercept to the fit line.

2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot? 

Because the total intercepts are the same to all points on both sides.
Timestamps values are the numeric values of created_at values.
