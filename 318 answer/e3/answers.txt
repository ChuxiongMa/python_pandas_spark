1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing?
What differences did you notice?

I think Kalman smoothing got a better result. Compared with LOESS smoothing, Kalman smoothing cover more
points and demonstrate better shape of points.

2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations:
time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s).
How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude?
[Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude
by the app: they don't really add much new information.]

Those data could be used to make a better prediction, such as predict next direction, but I think
the current latitude and longitude are the most important information for predicting next latitude
and longitude, so those date won't help too much.
