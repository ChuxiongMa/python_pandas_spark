1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

Square root


2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

Weekends have more comments than weekdays


3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

Transform data by using square root. Because this method output a nice p-value which close to 0.5


4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

Weekends
