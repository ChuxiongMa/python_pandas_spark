1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
Both Numpy and Pandas are using the same functions to do the calculation. I think Pandas is easier to work with and read.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
pivot_month_pandas: 20-25ms
pivot_month_loops: 500ms-600ms

Pandas library has the most effienent way to do the calculation, so its time is usually faster than other's code.
