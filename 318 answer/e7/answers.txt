1. Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?

Yes, data on the image ditribute normally, so p-value is reliable. I can conclude that the ratings are increasing.


2. Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

No, new prediction looks not that smooth as pervious one.
